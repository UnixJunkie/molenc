- test wmh_test.exe with molecules encoded with more features
  i.e. from another dataset with more molecules having
  been used to create the encoding dictionary

- use a single rand per feature test instead of two currently
  should accelerate the hashing rate

- pre-generate rands at init in a table
  - use a non repeating sequence of random integers
    i.e. a random permutation of all possible integers
  in case green is not reached after all possible rands, use -1
  as the number of rand trials before green (instead of an
  infinite hashing function)
