Molenc install guide
====================

Author: Francois Berenger
Date: 6th July 2022

Example installation instructions on a fresh Debian 11.3 system.
On Ubuntu Linux, installation should be very similar.

On Mac computers, this software has worked in the past, but
installation is a pain; hence we don't maintain anymore
neither recommend this setup.

The Bash shell is assumed for all commands.

Sudo rights are assumed for the user performing the installation.

I) Install system-wide packages
-------------------------------

$ sudo apt install git opam python3-pip python3-numpy

II) Configure the OCaml package manager
---------------------------------------

$ opam init -y
$ eval `opam config env` # path setup for ocaml executables
                         # might be needed in your ~/.bashrc

III) Install OCaml packages
---------------------------

$ opam depext -i molenc # this will also install rdkit system-wide

II) Install user-space packages
-------------------------------

$ pip3 install six # required by chemo-standardizer
$ pip3 install chemo-standardizer # requires system-wide rdkit

III) Tests
----------

Test the molecular standardiser is correctly installed.
It is used by molenc in case molecules need to be standardized.

$ standardiser -h

If not, it may be missing from PATH:

$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin # might be needed in your ~/.bashrc
$ standardiser -h # test again

IV) Encode some molecules
-------------------------

Get some molecules in the SMILES format:

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnixJunkie/molenc/master/data/chembl_antivirals.smi -O antivirals.smi

Encode those molecules using counted atom pairs fingerprint:

$ molenc.sh --pairs -i antivirals.smi -o antivirals_std.AP

Look at what was obtained:
$ head -1 antivirals_std.AP
CHEMBL807,0.0,[2:6;8:1;15:3;25:12;26:2;70:3;93:3;372:6;393:6;407:1;412:2;453:3;466:2;524:9;917:9;1095:3;1742:1;1776:3;2063:3;2576:4;2646:1;4428:3;5906:2;5916:1;6005:2]

V) Encode more molecules with an existing encoding dictionary
-------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say we want to encode some new molecules using an existing encoding dictionary
(a dictionary was created in the previous step for antivirals.smi).
In the real world, you might want the encoding dictionary to cover the whole ChEMBL database
(or your company's whole compound collection), so that the dictionary is exhaustive enough.

In the following, you need to replace MY_MOLECULES.smi with the SMILES file of your choice.

$ molenc.sh --pairs -d antivirals.smi.dix -i MY_MOLECULES.smi -o MY_MOLECULES_std.AP

Concluding remarks
------------------

Molenc is a research software prototype.
As such, it might be be a little difficult to install and under-documented.
So is the fate of research by-products.
Don't hesitate to contact the author in case you cannot install the software,
find any bug or encounter some problems while using it.
